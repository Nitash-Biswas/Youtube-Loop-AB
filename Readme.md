## 🎸 Why did I make this?

Ever tried learning a song from a YouTube tutorial and ended up looping the same 10 seconds **manually** like 20 times? 😤  
There's always that one riff, that one beat, or that tricky part that keeps slipping away.  
So you **pause**, **rewind**, **play**… and repeat. Again. And again. And again... 😵‍💫

Wouldn’t it be better if the video just **looped that part automatically**?  
Boom 💥 — that's where **Youtube-Loop-AB** comes in!
